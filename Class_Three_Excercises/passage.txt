Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) sprawls across more than 17,000 acres and serves as a
central hub connecting the southern United States to the rest of the world. On a busy spring
morning, Terminal D hummed with activity, as passengers from all over the globe navigated the wide
airside of the terminal, lined with shops, restaurants, and lounges.

I boarded an American Airlines Boeing 767-300ER bound for New York City JFK, appreciating the
aircraft’s spacious 2-3-2 seating layout in economy class. The 767, a wide-body twin-engine airliner
introduced in the 1980s, has long been valued for its fuel efficiency and smooth long-haul
performance. The cockpit, familiar to pilots who also fly the Boeing 757, featured advanced glass
panels that made navigation and communication seamless.

As the plane taxied to one of DFW’s seven runways, the scale of the airport became clear: multiple
aircraft taking off and landing simultaneously, while ground crews efficiently guided planes to
gates. Once airborne, the city of Dallas came into view below, highways and downtown skyscrapers
gradually surrounded by sprawling suburbs.

During the flight, passengers settled into the calm reliability of the 767, its steady cruise
altitude making the transnational flight feel shorter than expected. Flight attendants moved through
the aisles with practiced efficiency, serving snacks and drinks, and checking on travelers. Even
after decades in service, the Boeing 767 continued to impress with its balance of performance,
comfort, and dependability — a perfect match for a bustling hub like DFW Airport.
